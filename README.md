# EscaperoomNetworkTest
First version of setting up a connection between 2 players using Unity Multiplayer  after opening it in the Unity editor, you want to create a build of the project. Run the build and press play in the editor, these will be player 1 and 2. One of those should click the "Host" button and the other should press the "Client" button. When this is done there will be 2 dots visible. One of those is white (your own) the other one will be blue(the one from the other person). when you press move both players will see the cicles, that belongs to the one who pressed the move button, get moved to a new randomly selected location.
